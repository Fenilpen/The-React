// notes about hooks

// useCallback (memoizing): Think of it as a tool for memoizing functions. When you have functions that you pass down to child components, 
// using useCallback ensures that the function reference stays the same unless its dependencies change. 
// This helps in preventing unnecessary re-renders, optimizing performance.

// useEffect (run): This is your go-to hook for running side effects like data fetching, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions. 
// It runs after the component renders and can re-run based on the dependencies you specify.

// So, while useCallback helps in keeping functions stable, 
// useEffect is used to handle side effects that need to be executed after render.
