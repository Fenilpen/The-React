in order to learn react context you need to understand what is props
so here is the breaf 

In React, "props" stands for properties and refers to a way of passing data from one component to another, 
specifically from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only, 
meaning they cannot be modified by the child components that receive them; 
their purpose is to allow components to share and reuse data.

How it works: Props are passed into a component via attributes in JSX (JavaScript XML).
Use case: Theyâ€™re typically used to customize a component's behavior or appearance.

exmaple:- 

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Fenil" />;
}

The App component passes a name prop with the value "Fenil" to the Welcome component.
The Welcome component uses props.name to display "Hello, Fenil!"


Props are an essential part of React because they enable components to be dynamic and reusable
